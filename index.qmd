## Bio
I'm currently an MASc candidate in Systems Design Engineering at UWaterloo's Vision and Image Processing Lab, advised by Prof. [Alexander Wong](https://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~a28wong/index.html) and Prof. [Javad Shafiee](https://vip.uwaterloo.ca/m-shafiee/). My research has focused on projects at the intersection of **efficient ML** (specifically applying neural architecture search to NeRFs and vision transformers), **embedded systems** (latency prediction for on-device inference), and **robotics** (building simulation pipelines for synthetic data generation, training embodied morphologies, and dexterous manipulation). **I'm interested in building embodied systems that can efficiently learn to interact with the world in an open-ended manner.** 

I previously graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BASc in Mechatronics Engineering with an Option in Artificial Intelligence. As an undergraduate, I've interned as a software engineer across the full systems stack including sensor processing and communications infrastructure on self-driving cars, simulators for robot grasping, real-time video analytics applications for embedded microcontrollers, safety-critical bootloader firmware for aerospace products, silicon validation for AI accelerators, and web development for e-commerce.


I'm currently looking for new opportunities to build the next generation (and beyond) of robotics. If you're working on something interesting, or want to learn more, I'd love to chat!
