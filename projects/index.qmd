## NAS-NeRF
[**NAS-NeRF**](https://saeejithnair.github.io/NAS-NeRF/): We introduce a generative neural architecture search strategy that generates compact, scene-specialized NeRF architectures by balancing architecture complexity and target synthesis quality metrics. Our method incorporates constraints on target metrics and budgets to guide the search towards architectures tailored for each scene.
